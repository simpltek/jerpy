# Jerpy

## A tiny, super simple, flat-file CMS for small websites, built on PHP, Vue.js, and Bootstrap 5.

### Features

- Very small footprint (~256 Kb) - That's including Vue.js and Bootstrap 5!
- "Dynamic" page routing - Utilizes the ? search param character to provide mostly-friendly URL's. This avoids needing a redirect config (i.e. .htaccess), so can run on anything (apache, ngnix, etc.)
- Intuitive interface - Nicely spaced-out, simple layout, and just nice to look at :)

### Download

Just grab this repo, and unzip into your desired directory

To access the CMS, go to /backend.php and enter `admin`

To change the backend password, modify the PASSWORD constant at the top of backend.php
